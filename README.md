## Get Started

- Browse module overviews via the table above, then open the module’s README for links to unit plans and rubrics.
- Materials are plain Markdown – print or adapt as needed.
- Cross-links point to DPK units/examples/tasks for classroom handouts and code.

---

## Pedagogical Approach

The toolkit emphasizes inclusive, authentic learning:

1. Active making with purposeful artefacts and reflection.
2. Integration of code with content knowledge (STEAM).
3. Accessibility at design time (alt text, semantics, focus, contrast).

---

## Technical Requirements

- Any Markdown viewer (VS Code, GitHub, etc.).
- No build or external dependencies.

---

## Contribution and Collaboration

- Keep filenames lowercase and hyphen‑separated.
- Use inclusive language and provide accessibility notes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when adding or updating modules/units.
