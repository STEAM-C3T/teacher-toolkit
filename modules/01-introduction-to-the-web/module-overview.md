# Module 1: Introduction to the Web

Metadata

- Module: 01 • Version: 2025-11-18 • Audience: Upper primary / lower secondary and up

## Module Overview

Students learn what happens when a browser requests a page and build a minimal, semantic HTML document. The emphasis is on foundational web literacy (client–server model) and accessible structure (headings, landmarks, and descriptive links). No installs are required; everything runs in a modern browser.

## Learning Outcomes (DigComp 2.2 aligned)

- Describes how the web works (client → request → server → response).
- Identifies parts of an HTML document and explains the role of semantic tags.
- Produces a minimal, accessible HTML page with meaningful headings, lists, links, and images with alt text.
- Reflects on accessibility decisions (heading order, link text, image descriptions).

### Alignment (DigComp areas)

- Digital content creation (3.1, 3.2)
- Information and data literacy (1.1)
- Problem solving (5.3)
- Safety basics (privacy-aware linking, 4.1)

## Sequence & Timing (45–90 min)

1. Activate (5–10): “What happens when you type a URL?” Pair-share → whole-class recap.
2. Demo (10): Show request/response; View Source; semantic landmarks (header, main, footer).
3. Guided practice (15–25): Build a minimal page together using a starter template.
4. Independent task (10–25): First webpage with header/main/footer + links, list, image with alt.
5. Share & reflect (5–10): Gallery walk; two accessibility improvements identified.

## Materials & Setup

- Modern browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) with DevTools; text editor (VS Code or web-based).
- Optional projector to demonstrate View Source / Inspect.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- Use semantic landmarks and logical heading order (start at h1).
- Require descriptive link text (avoid “click here”).
- Ensure all meaningful images include appropriate alt text.
- Encourage keyboard checks (Tab through links → focus visible).

## Differentiation

- Scaffold: Provide a commented starter HTML template and a checklist.
- Extension: Add a simple navigation list, figure/figcaption, and cite sources with proper links.

## Assessment & Evidence

- Evidence: Student HTML file(s) + short reflection on semantic/accessibility choices.
- Use rubric: See [assessment-rubric-01.md](./assessment-rubric-01.md) for criteria and performance levels.

## Common Misconceptions & Tips

- “h1 is for big text”: clarify that headings express structure, not size.
- “Alt text = filename”: model concise, meaningful descriptions.

## Teacher Notes

- Accessibility: semantic landmarks, heading order, descriptive links, image alt text.
- Pedagogy: emphasise “make-and-explain” cycles; keep scope small and visible.
- Assessment: checklist for structure + reflection prompt on choices made.
