## Competence mapping (DigComp 2.2)
- 1.2 Evaluating data and information
- 3.1 Developing digital content (visual representations)
- 3.2 Integrating and re‑elaborating (from numbers to visuals)
- 5.1 Problem solving (implementing a scaling approach)
- 5.3 Creativity and innovation (design and presentation)

## Criteria and performance levels

- Data handling & scaling
  - Emerging: Uses raw values with incorrect or inconsistent scaling; bars do not reflect magnitudes.
  - Proficient: Computes max and applies a consistent scale so bar heights are proportional to values.
  - Exemplary: Chooses a sensible scale domain, handles edge cases (zero/large values), and documents the approach.

- Chart correctness
  - Emerging: Bars overlap or spacing is inconsistent; canvas size not suited to data.
  - Proficient: Bars are evenly spaced, fit the canvas, and no visual errors are present.
  - Exemplary: Layout adapts to dataset length; margins and bar width respond to canvas size.

- Labelling & readability
  - Emerging: Missing or illegible labels; unclear title.
  - Proficient: Title, axis/context labels, and value markers are clear and legible with appropriate contrast.
  - Exemplary: Labels aid interpretation (units, source); typography hierarchy improves readability.

- Accessibility
  - Emerging: Colour choice hinders readability; no non‑visual alternative.
  - Proficient: Colour choices meet contrast guidance; a companion HTML table presents the same data.
  - Exemplary: Adds patterns or annotations for colour‑blind users; keyboard focusable caption or summary provided.

- Reflection & justification
  - Emerging: Minimal or no explanation of design choices.
  - Proficient: Briefly explains dataset, scale, and label choices.
  - Exemplary: Critically evaluates trade‑offs (e.g., bar width vs. spacing) and proposes improvements.

## Evidence
- Canvas chart file and dataset (or inline array).
- Short reflection (3–5 sentences) describing scaling, labels, and design choices.

## Acceptance checklist
- [ ] Scaling is consistent and proportional.
- [ ] Bars are visible, non‑overlapping, and sized to canvas.
- [ ] Labels (title and values) are legible and contextual.
- [ ] Accessible alternative (HTML table) included.
- [ ] Reflection included.
