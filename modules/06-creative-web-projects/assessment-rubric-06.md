### Criteria and performance levels

- Functionality & control

  - Exemplary: Controls are intuitive; ranges chosen to prevent failure states.

- Visual coherence

  - Emerging: Visual is cluttered or lacks intent.
  - Proficient: Palette and composition feel deliberate and consistent.
  - Exemplary: Strong aesthetic; demonstrates iteration and refinement.

- Technical quality

  - Emerging: Inefficient or fragile code; performance issues.
  - Proficient: Clean, readable code; reasonable performance.
  - Exemplary: Thoughtful structure; avoids unnecessary work; comments guide readers.

- Accessibility & explanation
  - Emerging: Missing caption/description.
  - Proficient: Clear caption describing behaviour and controls.
  - Exemplary: Reflection connects design choices to audience and constraints.
