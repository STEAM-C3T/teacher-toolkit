# Module 6: Creative Web Projects

## Module Overview

### Learning outcomes (DigComp 2.2)

- Combine HTML, CSS, and JS to create a small interactive or generative artefact.
- Iterate on parameters and user feedback to refine design and functionality.
- Explain creative choices and constraints in plain language.

### Sequence

1. Inspiration and scope selection; small, feasible concept.
2. Prototype build: controls, visuals/interaction, iteration.
3. Guided critique and refinement.
4. Independent polish; share and reflect.

- Task: [Creative Poster](https://github.com/STEAM-C3T/digital-proficiency-kit/blob/main/modules/06-creative-web-projects/tasks/task-1-creative-poster.md)

### Teacher notes

- Encourage playful exploration with constraints (time, controls, colours).
- Keep scope small: 1–2 controls, a clear visual or interaction.
- Accessibility: provide a caption describing the artefact’s behaviour and intent.
