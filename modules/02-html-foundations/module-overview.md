# Module 2: HTML Foundations

Metadata

- Module: 02 • Version: 2025-11-18 • Audience: Lower/upper secondary

## Module Overview

Teachers guide students to structure content semantically and build basic forms and tables with accessibility in mind. The focus is on meaningful markup and programmatic associations (labels ↔ inputs, table headers ↔ cells).

## Learning Outcomes (DigComp 2.2)

- Structures content with headings, lists, links, figures/images and captions.
- Builds forms where every input has an associated label.
- Presents small datasets in tables using headers and an optional caption.
- Evaluates a page for semantic correctness and basic accessibility concerns.

### Alignment (DigComp areas)

- Digital content creation (3.1, 3.2)
- Information/data literacy (1.2)
- Safety (clear language and transparency, 4.1)

## Sequence & Timing (60–120 min)

1. Content blocks (10–15): headings hierarchy; lists; link text; image alt.
2. Forms (15–25): label–input association; required fields; help text.
3. Tables (10–15): headers with th; captions; when to avoid layout tables.
4. Guided practice (15–25): topic page + small survey/table.
5. Share & reflect (5–10): peer review with accessibility checklist.

## Materials & Setup

- Browser + editor; optional screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA) for checks.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- Labels must be programmatically associated; placeholders are not labels.
- Use captions to describe table purpose; keep reading order logical.
- Check keyboard navigation and visible focus.

## Differentiation

- Scaffold: Provide skeleton HTML with comments and TODOs.
- Extension: Add fieldset/legend groups, required indicators, validation hints.

## Assessment & Evidence

- Evidence: HTML page with content + form + small table; short reflection.
- Use rubric: See [assessment-rubric-02.md](./assessment-rubric-02.md).

## Teacher Notes

- Accessibility: heading order; alt text; labels/tables with headers.
- Differentiation: scaffolded skeleton; extension with anchors/TOC.
- Assessment: semantic correctness, clarity, and accessibility.
