# Module 7: Green STEAM Challenge

## Unit 7.1 – Build a Sustainability Mini‑App

### Outcomes

- Define a small problem and user; design one clear interaction.
- Implement minimal UI, state, and output with vanilla JS.
- Test with a peer and plan one improvement.

### Lesson flow

- Warm‑up (5’): brainstorm local sustainability challenges.
- Demo (10’): “Green Actions Tracker” (checkboxes + score + localStorage).
- Guided (15’): scaffold app state and a render() function.
- Practice (20’): implement interaction and polish copy.
- Share (5’): peer test and capture feedback.

### Materials

- DPK Unit: https://github.com/STEAM-C3T/digital-proficiency-kit/blob/main/modules/07-green-steam-challenge/units/unit-7.1-green-mini-app.md
- Example: https://github.com/STEAM-C3T/digital-proficiency-kit/blob/main/modules/07-green-steam-challenge/examples/green-mini-app.html
- Task: https://github.com/STEAM-C3T/digital-proficiency-kit/blob/main/modules/07-green-steam-challenge/tasks/task-1-sdg-mini-app.md

### Differentiation

- Provide starter HTML + state object; extension: persistence (localStorage) or a simple chart.

### Accessibility

- Label controls; ensure focus order; avoid jargon in labels and messages.

### Assessment

- Rubric: problem clarity, working interaction, basic state handling, and reflection quality.
