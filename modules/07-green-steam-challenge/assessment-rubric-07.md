## Assessment Rubric — Sustainability Mini‑App

### Competence mapping (DigComp 2.2)

- 3.1 Developing digital content
- 3.2 Integrating and re‑elaborating
- 4.2 Engaging in citizenship through digital technologies
- 5.1 Problem solving

### Criteria and performance levels

- Problem framing & purpose

  - Emerging: Vague problem or audience; unclear purpose.
  - Proficient: Clear local problem and target user; one focused goal.
  - Exemplary: Compelling purpose; constraints articulated; success criteria identified.

- Functionality & state

  - Emerging: Interaction fragile or inconsistent; state not managed.
  - Proficient: One key interaction works; simple state and render cycle.
  - Exemplary: Robust interaction; state persists or handles edge cases.

- UX & accessibility

  - Emerging: Unlabeled controls; confusing flow; poor copy.
  - Proficient: Labels present; predictable focus; clear microcopy.
  - Exemplary: Inclusive language; keyboard‑friendly; helpful feedback.

- Reflection & iteration
  - Emerging: Minimal reflection; no clear next step.
  - Proficient: Summarises feedback and proposes one improvement.
  - Exemplary: Weighs trade‑offs; plans feasible iterations with rationale.

### Evidence

- Working prototype; short reflection (5–7 sentences) and a peer feedback note.
