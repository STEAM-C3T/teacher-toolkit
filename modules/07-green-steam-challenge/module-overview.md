# Module 7: Green STEAM Challenge

Metadata

- Module: 07 • Version: 2025-11-18 • Audience: Lower/upper secondary

## Module Overview

Students apply their skills to an SDG‑aligned mini‑app with a clear, narrow purpose (one key interaction). They plan user flow, prototype with semantic HTML + JS, consider ethics/privacy (e.g., localStorage), and communicate impact honestly.

## Learning Outcomes (DigComp 2.2)

- Scopes and implements a small app addressing a sustainability/SDG problem.
- Designs a minimal UI and manages simple state and outputs.
- Communicates impact and limitations; considers data ethics and privacy.

### Alignment (DigComp areas)

- Digital content creation (3.1, 3.2)
- Problem solving (5.3)
- Safety (privacy, transparency 4.1)

## Sequence & Timing (90–180 min)

1. Problem + users (15): define a narrow goal and single core interaction.
2. Prototype (25–45): semantic UI; state; minimal output; optional persistence.
3. Peer test (10–20): small usability test; note one actionable change.
4. Iterate (20–40): apply change; improve copy/accessibility.
5. Present (10–20): problem, solution, impact, and next steps.

## Materials & Setup

- Browser + editor; optional open datasets (CSV/JSON); simple testing checklist.

## Accessibility, Ethics & Privacy

- Keyboard operability; labelled controls; meaningful text.
- If using localStorage: disclose what is stored, why, and how to reset.
- Avoid collecting personal/sensitive data; provide clear language.

## Differentiation

- Scaffold: Starter skeleton with sections and placeholder handlers.
- Extension: Import a small dataset; add filters and a tiny visualization.

## Assessment & Evidence

- Evidence: HTML/JS, short demo notes, and reflection on impact/ethics.
- Use rubric: See [assessment-rubric-07.md](./assessment-rubric-07.md).

## Teacher Notes

- Keep scope small (1–2 screens); define a single, valuable interaction.
- Accessibility and plain language are central to impact and inclusion.
